2014.2:
 * Version 12.0 (Rev. 4)
 * No changes

2014.1:
 * Version 12.0 (Rev. 4)
 * Core will now deliver an ooc_xdc file, without constraints, when latency is zero.
 * Internal device family name change, no functional changes
 * Netlists created by write_verilog and write_vhdl are IEEE P1735 encrypted, with keys for supported simulators so that netlist simulation can still be done
 * Enable third party synthesis tools to read encrypted netlists (but not source HDL)
 * GUI bug fixed regarding the update of Latency when in Automatic latency configuration when widths changed.
 * display name changed from Adder Subtracter to Adder/Subtracter to match Product Guide.
 * Support for Virtex Ultrascale devices at Pre-Production Status

2013.4:
 * Version 12.0 (Rev. 3)
 * Latency is now restricted to the output width. Previously the GUI allowed illegal values
 * Tooltips added to GUI
 * Support for Kintex Ultrascale devices at Pre-Production Status

2013.3:
 * Version 12.0 (Rev. 2)
 * Behavioral VHDL model replaced by Encrypted RTL. For more information on this change please refer to the Migrating and Upgrading section in the Product Guide
 * Internal standardization in source file delivery, does not change behavior
 * Support for Automotive Artix-7, Automotive Zynq, Defense Grade Artix-7, Defense Grade Zynq and Lower Power Artix-7 devices at Production Status
 * Added default constraints for out of context flow
 * Added support for IP Integrator
 * Added support for Cadence IES and Synopsys VCS simulators

2013.2:
 * Version 12.0 (Rev. 1)
 * Support for Series 7 devices at Production status
 * Updated clock and bus interface associations for IP Integrator support
 * Removing support for Defense Grade Low Power Artix7

2013.1:
 * Version 12.0
 * Native Vivado Release
 * Changed all port names to upper case
 * There have been no functional changes to this IP.  The version number has changed to support unique versioning in Vivado starting with 2013.1.
